server_name/ Server Name Indication TLS extension:
            TLS does not provide a mechanism for a client to tell a server the
            name of the server it is contacting.  It may be desirable for clients
            to provide this information to facilitate secure connections to
            servers that host multiple 'virtual' servers at a single underlying
            network address.

            In order to provide the server name, clients MAY include an extension
            of type "server_name" in the (extended) client hello.  The
            "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL contain
            "ServerNameList" where:

            struct {
            	NameType name_type;
            	select (name_type) {
            		case host_name: HostName;
            		} name;
            } ServerName;

            enum {
            	host_name(0), (255)
            } NameType;

            opaque HostName<1..2^16-1>;

            struct {
            	ServerName server_name_list<1..2^16-1>
            } ServerNameList;

========================================================

SSL 3.0

		SSLv3 is identical to TLS as described, with one exception - in theory SSLv3 ClientHello packet doesn't have an extensions field.
		In theory SSLv3 doesn't do SNI. In practice this is more complicated. TLS 1.0 also doesn't specify extensions field,
		but most clients do send them anyway.
